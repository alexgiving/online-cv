        link: https://github.com/alexgiving/LKMeans
        tagline: |
          LKMeans is a Python library that extends the functionality of the KMeans algorithm by allowing clusterization using the Minkowski metric instead of the traditional Euclidean distance.
          Investigated the theoretical foundation of high-dimensional data clustering improvement.
          Researched and developed Minkowski centroid optimization methodology.
          Implemented from scratch centroid-based algorithm for clustering high-dimensional data.
          Achieved up to 15% accuracy improvement on ARI and AMI metrics.
          Successfully defended research paper before the scientific council of the university.
